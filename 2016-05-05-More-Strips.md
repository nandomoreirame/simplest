We then tried to take it a step further and look at the dynamics of how the yields on these changed over time.
We pulled data from Bloomberg on all of the strips maturing for the next 20 years, and took daily data on the yield going back to the beginning of 2010
The X-axis contains different strips, in ascending order of maturity, and the Y-axis is the dates we pulled.
This graph is also interactive: you can zoom, rotate it, or pan around. Pretty Cool!
