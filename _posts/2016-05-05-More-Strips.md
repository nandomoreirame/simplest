We pulled data from Bloomberg on all of the strips maturing for the next 20 years, and took daily data on the yield going back to the beginning of 2010
The X-axis contains different strips, in ascending order of maturity, and the Y-axis is the dates we pulled.
This graph is also interactive: you can zoom, rotate it, or pan around. Pretty Cool!
