Well that's all we've got for now! Thanks for visiting and checking out what we've been up to this semester.
We wanted to take this space and show our thanks for everyone who made this class possible, especially George Hall, for volunteering his time, and Aldo Musacchio for pushing to get this class included in the curriculum!

All of our code and data is available through the plotly pages linked.

In this class, we used a variety of languages (Python, Git, html, Sphinx) and modules (plotly, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, Jekyll, beautifulsoup). We would like to extend our thanks to the developers of these
