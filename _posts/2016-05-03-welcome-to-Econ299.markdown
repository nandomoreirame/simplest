Welcome to the Web Page for Python for Economics! Four Students embarked on this journey to learn one of the most powerful languages for data analysis

We have created this page, hosted through Github, to show off what we have learned and worked on throughout the semester. 
Each of our projects will be hosted under a different post, so be sure to check them all out!
