Revolutionary Bills:
Our other project was to look at bonds the Continental government issued during the Revolutionary War in the US.
These IOU's were written when the Army was in need of supplies, and were then collected and repaid after the US won the war.
We were given data on the size, and date of the bond, as well as the name of the person the bond was made out to
These were also put into graphs, to visualize when and where the bonds were distributed
